    <h1>Music and Artists:</h1>
    <p>
        Italy has a long musical tradition that goes back centuries.<br>
        In classical music, Italy gave us opera, a dramatic and emotional form of singing. Famous opera singers like Luciano Pavarotti and Andrea Bocelli are loved all around the world.<br>
        In modern music, Italy also has pop and romantic songs that people dance to in summer festivals.<br>
        Italian instruments like the violin and piano were both invented or developed in Italy!<br>
        Music in Italy is full of emotion â€” it's about love, passion, and living life fully.
