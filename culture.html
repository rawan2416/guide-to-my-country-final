    <h1>Culture and Tradditions:</h1>
    <p>
        Italians are known for being friendly, expressive, and family-oriented.<br>
        Family is at the center of Italian life — Sunday lunches with grandparents are a must!<br>
        Fashion is part of daily culture — Italians always dress stylishly, even just to buy bread.<br>
        Festivals are colorful and full of energy — like Venice Carnival, Siena Horse Race, and Christmas markets.<br>
        Italians greet with kisses on both cheeks and talk with their hands — it's part of their charm.<br>
        The Italian language itself sounds musical — it flows beautifully and is often called “the language of love.”
